## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 5

Upgrades directly from 3.7 to 5 may be possible by partnering with EDB Professional Services, or reaching out to EDB support for assistance. 

Currently there are no direct upgrade paths from 3.7 to 5 using TPA. If using TPA for upgrades, you must first upgrade your cluster to 4.3.0 or later before upgrading to 5. See [Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 4](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/4/upgrades/upgrade_paths/#upgrading-from-version-37-to-version-4) documentation for more information.

Development is underway to provide a direct upgrade path from 3.7 to 5 using TPA by Q4.
